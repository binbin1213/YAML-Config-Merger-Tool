/**
 * This file includes tests for the YamlProcessorService and ConfigMergerComponent.
 *
 * Note: Angular 21+ uses a new test setup. If you encounter issues,
 * you may need to configure karma or another test runner.
 *
 * For now, the test files are in place:
 * - src/services/yaml-processor.service.spec.ts
 * - src/components/config-merger.component.spec.ts
 *
 * To run tests, use:
 * npm run test
 * npm run test:headless
 * npm run test:coverage
